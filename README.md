# Documentation
* write proper documentation
    * one for users (generic use stuff)
    * one for devs/in depth
        * what do the functions do/idea behind them

# ideas/todo
* rotations could be done differently:
    * take min/max/middle axis of dim
    * rotate this to align with axis
    * problem with middle -> how to find, need to be already orth on 1 axis


* dxf files/implementation
